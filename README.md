# Sentiment_Analysis_from_Airline_Tweets <Kaggle>

### Motivation
My goal for this project includes the following
- To maximise my time at home during my country's lockdown (circuit breaker)
- Widen my knowledge on using natural language processing using NLTK
- Hone my Tensorflow coding skills
- Learn more about RNN and LSTM

### Synopsis
As the pace of A.I. advances at a increasing rate, one thing that we constantly wonder is if or when will A.I. gain the ability to acknowledge feelings. With the surge in research papers and people stepping into the field of natural language processing, we are definitely closer to that reality.

The aim of this project will be to use a different approach, as compared to using TF-IDF right away in the fake news filter project, to predict if the sentiment of the words given to the model is positive, neutral or negative. I will be using NLTK for creating a bag of words, creating a function to remove unwanted characters and lemmatisation. 

Then several supervised machine learning algorithms will be tested as well along with trying of ensemble learning at the end. The project will also have another part where I will be using Neural Networks (RNN and LSTM) to improve the model's accuracy.

You may find more information about my thought process about the work along the way and code in 'Sentiment_Analysis_on_Tweets.ipynb' and download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/syedrz/twitterairlinesentiment
